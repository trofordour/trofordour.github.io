Write a program to sum a list of numbers.

The output should look something like this:

Enter some integers you want me to add up (one integer per line).

Terminate your list of numbers by entering anything that is not an integer.

Enter a number to add (or 'q' to quit): 5
Enter another number to add (or 'q' to quit): 4
Enter another number to add (or 'q' to quit): 45
Enter another number to add (or 'q' to quit): 76
Enter another number to add (or 'q' to quit): 

Sum of your numbers = 130
