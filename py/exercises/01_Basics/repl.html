<h3>REPL - Read, Execute, Print, Loop</h3>
<div class='description'>
A program that prompts for a command, executes it, and then prompts for a another command in order to repeat the process, is often referred to as a REPL, which stands for:
<ul><li><strong>R</strong>ead command</li>
<li><strong>E</strong>xecute command</li>
<li><strong>P</strong>rint result</li>
<li><strong>L</strong>oop back to the beginning</li></ul>Every program you can install to work with Python provides a REPL that understands how to interpret and execute Python. One of the first things you should do is find out how to run the REPL for the version of Python that you have installed.

The REPL provides an invaluable tool for understanding how Python works in practice. When you are stuck with something, use the REPL to experiment with different ideas and potential solutions.</div>
