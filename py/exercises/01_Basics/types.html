<h3>Types</h3>
<div class='description'>
Write a program that starts with the following function. Use copy/paste to place this code in your program, to avoid typos.
<pre class='sample-code'>
def type_of(value):
    return value.__class__.__name__
</pre>The function returns the name of the type of the value it is given, as a string.

Use the function to display the type names of various different values.

Tips:

A tuple is like a list, but the number of items in a tuple is fixed (it is not possible to append new items, for example).

"dict" is short for "dictionary", and is the basis of how Python implements Object Oriented Programming. This is a more advanced concept that tends to be introduced later on in any coding course.</div>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>
Type of 'hello world' is str

Type of 1 is int

Type of 1.0 is float

Type of True is bool

Type of [] is list

Type of () is tuple

Type of {} is dict
</pre>
</body>
