<h3>Floating-point numbers</h3>
Computers represent real numbers using floating-point numbers (or floats for short).

To say it another way: a floating-point number is a number with a decimal point.

Write a simple program that prompts for the radius of a circle, and calculates the circle's circumference and area.

Tip: circumference = 2 * π * r

Tip: area = π * r ** 2

Use a constant value of 3.142 for π.

Tip: the float() function can be used to convert a string to a float.

<h3>Sample output</h3>
Enter the radius of a circle: <strong>1.0</strong>

Circumference of your circle = 6.284

Area of your circle = 3.142
