<h3>Write a file</h3>
<div class='description'>
Make a new version of your times table program that writes its output to a .txt file.

Tips

Opening a file as shown below will allow you to call the .writelines() method on the file, to write out one or more lines.

You must place the newline character ("\n") at the end of each string you write to ensure that it appears on its own line in the output.
<pre>
with open('hello.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines("hello world\n")
</pre></div>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>
Enter the number of the times table you want me to print: 4

Enter the name of the file you want me to print the output to: four-times.txt

----- start of content from four-times.txt-----
1 * 4 = 4
2 * 4 = 8
3 * 4 = 12
4 * 4 = 16
5 * 4 = 20
6 * 4 = 24
7 * 4 = 28
8 * 4 = 32
9 * 4 = 36
10 * 4 = 40
11 * 4 = 44
12 * 4 = 48

------ end of content from four-times.txt------</pre>
