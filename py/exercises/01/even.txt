Write a simple program that can tell if a number is odd or even.

Hint: the % operator calculates the remainder of an integer division.

The output should look something like this:


I can tell you if an integer is odd or even

Enter an integer: 3

3 is odd


I can tell you if an integer is odd or even

Enter an integer: 356

356 is even
