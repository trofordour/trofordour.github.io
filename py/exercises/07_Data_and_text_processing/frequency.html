<h3>Calculating frequency of data items</h3>
<div class='description'>
In this exercise we revisit the earlier "dice" exercise where you wrote a program to print every comination of numbers that can be rolled on two dice.

Extend the dice program you wrote earlier to calculate and print how often each sum of two dice occurs.
<ul><li>Which result is most likely to occur when rolling two dice?</li>
<li>Which results are least likely to occur?</li></ul></div>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
1 + 3 = 4
1 + 4 = 5
1 + 5 = 6
1 + 6 = 7
2 + 1 = 3
2 + 2 = 4
2 + 3 = 5
2 + 4 = 6
2 + 5 = 7
2 + 6 = 8
3 + 1 = 4
3 + 2 = 5
3 + 3 = 6
3 + 4 = 7
3 + 5 = 8
3 + 6 = 9
4 + 1 = 5
4 + 2 = 6
4 + 3 = 7
4 + 4 = 8
4 + 5 = 9
4 + 6 = 10
5 + 1 = 6
5 + 2 = 7
5 + 3 = 8
5 + 4 = 9
5 + 5 = 10
5 + 6 = 11
6 + 1 = 7
6 + 2 = 8
6 + 3 = 9
6 + 4 = 10
6 + 5 = 11
6 + 6 = 12

2 occurs 1 times
3 occurs 2 times
4 occurs 3 times
5 occurs 4 times
6 occurs 5 times
7 occurs 6 times
8 occurs 5 times
9 occurs 4 times
10 occurs 3 times
11 occurs 2 times
12 occurs 1 times
