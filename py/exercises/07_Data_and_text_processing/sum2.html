<h3>Cleaning up input data</h3>
<div class='description'>
In practice, input data is not always in the desired format, and some pre-processing is required to transform it, before the real work can be done.

Add more code to the previous program (sum1) to deal with input data that contains lines of text, blank lines, and spaces around the numbers that are to be added.
<ul><li>Lines containing text and blank lines can be ignored.</li>
<li>Use the .strip() method to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of each line of data.</ul>Tips:

The following function will return True if a string only contains digits, and can be safely transformed into an int using the int() function.
<pre class='sample-code'>
def is_number(string):
    return string != '' and all(char.isdigit() for char in string)
</pre></div>
