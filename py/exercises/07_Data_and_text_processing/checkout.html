<h3>Supermarket checkout</h3>
<div class='description'>
Given a file called <strong>products.txt</strong> that contains a list of the products stocked in a supermarket, with their prices, and a file called <strong>shopping.txt</strong> that contains a list of items that a shopper is purchasing, and their quantities, print the receipt, which includes a calculation of the overall cost to the shopper.

Tips:

The input data files (see example output below) contain <em>structured data</em>. Each line consists of two fields separated by a <em>separator</em> character.
<ul><li>In products.txt, there are two fields (product name and product price) seperated by the "$" character.</li>
<li>In shopping.txt, there are two fields (product name and quatity) separated by the "#" character.</li></ul>Each line of data can be easily broken up into its component parts by using the .split() method.

For example, the following code splits a string on the '$' character, and then extracts the product name and price, stripping the whitespace from each field, and converting its data type, if necessary:
<pre class='sample-code'>
    tokens = product.split('$')

    product_name = tokens[0].strip()
    product_price = float(tokens[1].strip())
</pre></div>
