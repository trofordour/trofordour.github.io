<h3>Prime numbers</h3>
Write a program that calculates and prints the prime numbers, in order, in the range from 1 to 100.

Tips:

2 is the first prime number (1 is not prime).

No even number greater than 2 can be a prime number (because it is divisible by 2).

i.e. if n % 2 == 0 then n is not prime.

Every non-prime number greater than 1 is divisible by a prime number.

To use the above rule efficiently it is necessary to keep track of prime numbers generated so far (e.g. using a list).

As an entry level solution, the program can be written without lists (or other data structures).

To check if an odd number n is prime, divide it by all odd numbers in the range 3 to n // 2.

i.e. if n is an odd number, for each odd number i in the range 3 to n // 2, if n % i == 0 then n is not prime.
