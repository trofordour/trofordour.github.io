Great Expectations by Charles Dickens

Chapter 1

My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names
nothing longer or more explicit than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.

I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister -- Mrs Joe Gargery, who
married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their
days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like, were unreasonably
derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father's, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout,
dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, 'Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,' I
drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a
half long which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of
mine -- who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle -- I am indebted for a belief I
religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers- pockets, and had
never taken them out in this state of existence.

Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid
and broad impression of the identity of things, seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards
evening. At such a time I found out for certain, that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and
that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander,
Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the
dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with dykes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding
on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond, was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which
the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was
Pip.

Chapter 1

My father's family name being Pirrip, and my
Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make
of both names nothing longer or more explicit than
Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be
called Pip.

I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the
authority of his tombstone and my sister -- Mrs
Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I
never saw my father or my mother, and never saw
any likeness of either of them (for their days
were long before the days of photographs), my
first fancies regarding what they were like, were
unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The
shape of the letters on my father's, gave me an
odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,
with curly black hair. From the character and turn
of the inscription, 'Also Georgiana Wife of the
Above,' I drew a childish conclusion that my
mother was freckled and sickly. To five little
stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long
which were arranged in a neat row beside their
grave, and were sacred to the memory of five
little brothers of mine -- who gave up trying to
get a living, exceedingly early in that universal
struggle -- I am indebted for a belief I
religiously entertained that they had all been
born on their backs with their hands in their
trousers- pockets, and had never taken them out in
this state of existence.

Ours was the marsh country, down by the river,
within, as the river wound, twenty miles of the
sea. My first most vivid and broad impression of
the identity of things, seems to me to have been
gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards
evening. At such a time I found out for certain,
that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was
the churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of
this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the above,
