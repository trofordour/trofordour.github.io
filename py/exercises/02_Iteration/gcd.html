<h3>Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)</h3>
<div class='description'>
Write a program to compute the GCD of two positive integers using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">Euclid's algorithm</a>.

The subtraction-based version of the algorithm (summarised below) is probably the easiest version to understand and implement, initially.

Tips:

The GCD of two positive integers is the largest positive integer that divides them both (remainder zero).

In summary: Euclid's method for computing the GCD of two positive integers consists of replacing the larger number by the difference of the numbers, and repeating this until the two numbers are equal.

When the two numbers have become equal, the algorithm stops, and this equality is the GCD of the original two numbers.</div>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>
Enter two positive integers and I will calculate the greatest common divisor using Euclid's algorithm

Enter a number: <strong>7350</strong>

Enter another number: <strong>906</strong>

7350 - 906 = 6444

6444 - 906 = 5538

5538 - 906 = 4632

4632 - 906 = 3726

3726 - 906 = 2820

2820 - 906 = 1914

1914 - 906 = 1008

1008 - 906 = 102

906 - 102 = 804

804 - 102 = 702

702 - 102 = 600

600 - 102 = 498

498 - 102 = 396

396 - 102 = 294

294 - 102 = 192

192 - 102 = 90

102 - 90 = 12

90 - 12 = 78

78 - 12 = 66

66 - 12 = 54

54 - 12 = 42

42 - 12 = 30

30 - 12 = 18

18 - 12 = 6

12 - 6 = 6

The greatest common divisor of 7350 and 906 is 6

7350 = 6 * 1225

906 = 6 * 151</pre>
