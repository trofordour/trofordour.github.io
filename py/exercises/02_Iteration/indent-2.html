<h3>Printing shapes using text - triangles</h3>
Write a program that prompts the user for an odd number.

Print a triangle with a base of length equal to the number entered.

Use the asterisk character to form the edges of the triangle.

Tips:

If the number entered by the user is n, the height of the triangle (the number of rows to be printed) will be: n // 2 + 1

If we call the top of the triangle row 0, the second line, row 1, and so on, the number of spaces before the first asterisk in each line (the indent) will be: n // 2 - row

For middle rows (not the top or bottom), the number of spaces to place in the middle of each row (the gap) is: row * 2 - 1
