<h3>Indenting text</h3>
<div class='description'>
Write a program to prompt for a word and a number.

Print the word out the entered number of times.

Indent the word by one additional space each time it is printed.

Tips:

Use the range() function to create a for-loop that repeats an operation a fixed number of times. For example, the following loop prints the numbers 0 to 9:
<pre class='sample-code'>
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
</pre>There are different ways that the required level of indentation can be achieved in Python.

The approach recommended for this entry level exercise, is to generate a prefix, consisting of the required number of spaces, to print at the beginning of each line.

Multiplying the space character by a number generates a string of spaces with a length equal to the number.

For example, " " * 3 generates the following string of three spaces: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;".
</div>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>
Enter a word: <strong>foo</strong>

Enter the number of times to print the word: <strong>10</strong>

foo
 foo
  foo
   foo
    foo
     foo
      foo
       foo
        foo
         foo
</pre>
</body>
</html>
