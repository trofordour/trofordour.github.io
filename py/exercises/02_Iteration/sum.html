<h3>Summing a list of numbers</h3>
<div class='description'>
Write a program to prompt the user for a list of numbers; and then print out the sum of the entered numbers.

Tips:

Use a while-loop to iterate until some condition becomes true e.g. the user enters a certain string, like 'q'. Here's an example:
<pre class='sample-code'>
answer = input('Enter Q to quit:')

while answer.upper() != 'Q':
    print('You said:', answer)
    answer = input('Enter Q to quit:')
</pre>The most important thing to remember when writing a while-loop is that something must happen inside the body of the loop that can change the <em>termination condition</em> (i.e. the logical expression on the line starting with while).

In the example above, the user is always prompted for a new answer, as the last action in the loop's body.

A common bug in while-loops is that the developer forgets to implement the above rule, and the program becomes trapped in the loop forever, creating an <em>infinite-loop</em>.
</div>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>
Enter some integers you want me to add up (one integer per line).

Terminate your list of numbers by entering anything that is not an integer.

Enter a number to add (or 'q' to quit): <strong>4</strong>
Enter another number to add (or 'q' to quit): <strong>67</strong>
Enter another number to add (or 'q' to quit): <strong>32</strong>
Enter another number to add (or 'q' to quit): <strong>8</strong>
Enter another number to add (or 'q' to quit): <strong>q</strong>

Sum of your numbers = 111
