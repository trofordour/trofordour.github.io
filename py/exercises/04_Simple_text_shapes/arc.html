<h3>Plotting a curve</h3>
<div class='description'>
Write a simple program to print a curve from asterisk characters.

Tips:

In a simple program that can only print text characters, we can implement a system of coordinates by saying that
the first line to be printed equates to y = 0, the second line y = 1, and so on; and the number of spaces on a
line before a character is printed gives us a character's x coordinate.

Simple curves can be plotted by adapting Pythagoras theorem:

h<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>

A key observation is that for every point on the circumference of a circle, a right-angle triangle can be drawn
where the hypotenuse (h), starting at the origin of the circle, is the radius (r).

If such a circle is centered at the origin of a graph, at point (0, 0), the lengths of the sides of the right-angle
triangles, with hypotenuse originating at (0, 0) and length r, equate to the x and y coordinates.

r<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>

In our simple text program, we always know what y is (because we are printing the first line, second line, etc).

The x coordinate of the circumference, for a given y, can be calculated by solving the above equation for x.

In python:

x = round(math.sqrt(r**2 - y**2))
