<h3>Bubble sort</h3>
<div class='description'>
Implement bubble sort on a list of random numbers.

Tips:

To perform bubble sort, we perform a series of iterations over the list. In each iteration, we compare each item with the next item in the list. If two items are not in the desired order, we swap them.

At the end of each pass, the largest value in the list will have been moved to the end (the largest value "bubbles up", hence the name of the algorithm).

At the end of a pass, since the largest item has been moved into the correct position (at the end of the list), the next pass does not need to consider the last item i.e. each pass needs to consider one less item than the previous pass.

If, after a pass, no items were swapped, then all items in the list must now be in the correct order, and the algorithm can stop.

Use code from the previous exercises to:
<ul><li>generate an initial list of random numbers to be sort</li>
<li>compare two items in a list</li>
<li>swap two numbers in a list</li>
</ul></div>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>
Initial list: [93, 4, 2, 49, 4]
List length: 5

=== Pass 1. Sorted items: 0.
Swapping item 0 = 93 with item 1 = 4
Before: [93, 4, 2, 49, 4]
After:  [4, 93, 2, 49, 4]

Swapping item 1 = 93 with item 2 = 2
Before: [4, 93, 2, 49, 4]
After:  [4, 2, 93, 49, 4]

Swapping item 2 = 93 with item 3 = 49
Before: [4, 2, 93, 49, 4]
After:  [4, 2, 49, 93, 4]

Swapping item 3 = 93 with item 4 = 4
Before: [4, 2, 49, 93, 4]
After:  [4, 2, 49, 4, 93]


=== Pass 2. Sorted items: 1.
Swapping item 0 = 4 with item 1 = 2
Before: [4, 2, 49, 4, 93]
After:  [2, 4, 49, 4, 93]

Item 1 = 4 and item 2 = 49 are in the correct order

Swapping item 2 = 49 with item 3 = 4
Before: [2, 4, 49, 4, 93]
After:  [2, 4, 4, 49, 93]


=== Pass 3. Sorted items: 2.
Item 0 = 2 and item 1 = 4 are in the correct order

Item 1 = 4 and item 2 = 4 are in the correct order


=== Sort complete
Final sorted list: [2, 4, 4, 49, 93]</pre>
