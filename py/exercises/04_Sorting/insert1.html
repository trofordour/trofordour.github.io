<h3>Insert one item into a sorted list</h3>
<div class='description'>
Create a new program that begins with the following line:
<pre class='sample-code'>
nums = [4, 12, 15, 27, 29, 46, 61, 76, 94, 96]
</pre>nums is a sorted list of random numbers (sorted lowest to highest).

Ask the user to enter a number. Convert the input value from a string to an int using the int() function. Insert the entered number into the list above, maintaining the sort order (lowest to highest).

This requires iterating over the list, from beginning to end, comparing each existing list item with the new value, until either:
<ul><li>an existing item is found that is larger than the new value, which means that the new value should be inserted before this bigger item;
<li>or, the end of the list is reached, which means the new value is bigger than any existing item, and the new value should be appended to the list.</li></ul>Move the code that inserts a number into the list into a function that starts as shown below:
<pre class='sample-code'>
def insert1(list, num):
    # Insert num into sorted list
</pre>
Tips:

Use the .insert(index, item) method to insert an item into a list before a given index.

Use the .append(item) method to add an item to the end of a list.</div>

Final list: [1, 4, 12, 15, 27, 29, 46, 61, 76, 94, 96]



Initial list: [4, 12, 15, 27, 29, 46, 61, 76, 94, 96]

Enter a number to insert into the list: 50

Final list: [4, 12, 15, 27, 29, 46, 50, 61, 76, 94, 96]



Initial list: [4, 12, 15, 27, 29, 46, 61, 76, 94, 96]

Enter a number to insert into the list: 100
