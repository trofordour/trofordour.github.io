<h3>Insertion sort based on creating a new list</h3>
<div class='description'>
Implement insertion sort on a list of random numbers.

To perform insertion sort, we iterate over the original list. We insert each item from the original list into a new sorted list, placing each item in the correct position in the new list.

The new sorted list is initially empty i.e. it can be initialized as follows:
<pre class='sample-code'>
sorted_list = []
</pre>Inserting an item into the correct position in a sorted list can be easily accomplished using the insert1 function we developed in the previous exercise.
</div>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>
Initial list: [74, 49, 100, 65, 46, 70, 41, 37, 44, 43]
List length: 10

Inserting 74 into []
[74]

Inserting 49 into [74]
[49, 74]

Inserting 100 into [49, 74]
[49, 74, 100]

Inserting 65 into [49, 74, 100]
[49, 65, 74, 100]

Inserting 46 into [49, 65, 74, 100]
[46, 49, 65, 74, 100]

Inserting 70 into [46, 49, 65, 74, 100]
[46, 49, 65, 70, 74, 100]

Inserting 41 into [46, 49, 65, 70, 74, 100]
[41, 46, 49, 65, 70, 74, 100]

Inserting 37 into [41, 46, 49, 65, 70, 74, 100]
[37, 41, 46, 49, 65, 70, 74, 100]

Inserting 44 into [37, 41, 46, 49, 65, 70, 74, 100]
[37, 41, 44, 46, 49, 65, 70, 74, 100]

Inserting 43 into [37, 41, 44, 46, 49, 65, 70, 74, 100]
[37, 41, 43, 44, 46, 49, 65, 70, 74, 100]
