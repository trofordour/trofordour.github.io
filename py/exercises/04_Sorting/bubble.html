<h3>Bubble sort</h3>
<div class='description'>
Implement bubble sort on a list of random numbers.

Tips:

Use code from the previous exercises to:

* generate an initial list of random numbers to be sort

* provide a function to compare two items in a list

* swap two numbers in a list</div>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>
Initial list: [93, 4, 2, 49, 4]
List length: 5

=== Pass 1. Sorted items: 0.
Swapping item 0 = 93 with item 1 = 4
Before: [93, 4, 2, 49, 4]
After:  [4, 93, 2, 49, 4]

Swapping item 1 = 93 with item 2 = 2
Before: [4, 93, 2, 49, 4]
After:  [4, 2, 93, 49, 4]

Swapping item 2 = 93 with item 3 = 49
Before: [4, 2, 93, 49, 4]
After:  [4, 2, 49, 93, 4]

Swapping item 3 = 93 with item 4 = 4
Before: [4, 2, 49, 93, 4]
After:  [4, 2, 49, 4, 93]


=== Pass 2. Sorted items: 1.
Swapping item 0 = 4 with item 1 = 2
Before: [4, 2, 49, 4, 93]
After:  [2, 4, 49, 4, 93]

Item 1 = 4 and item 2 = 49 are in the correct order

Swapping item 2 = 49 with item 3 = 4
Before: [2, 4, 49, 4, 93]
After:  [2, 4, 4, 49, 93]


=== Pass 3. Sorted items: 2.
Item 0 = 2 and item 1 = 4 are in the correct order

Item 1 = 4 and item 2 = 4 are in the correct order


=== Sort complete
Final sorted list: [2, 4, 4, 49, 93]</pre>
