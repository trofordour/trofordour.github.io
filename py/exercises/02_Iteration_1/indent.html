<h3>Indenting text</h3>
<div class='description'>
Write a program to prompt for a word and a number.

Print the word out the entered number of times.

Indent the word by one additional space each time it is printed.

Tips:

There are different ways that the required level of indentation can be achieved in Python.

For example, the rjust() method can be used to right justify the word.

Another possibility is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language">Format String Syntax</a>.

The approach recommended for this entry level exercise, is to generate a prefix, consisting of the required number of spaces, to print at the beginning of each line.

Multiplying the space character by a number generates a string of spaces with a length equal to the number.

For example, " " * 3 generates the following string of three spaces: "   ".
</div>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>
Enter a word: <strong>foo</strong>

Enter the number of times to print the word: <strong>10</strong>

foo
 foo
  foo
   foo
    foo
     foo
      foo
       foo
        foo
         foo
</pre>
</body>
</html>
