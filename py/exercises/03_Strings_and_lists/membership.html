<h3>Testing for membership</h3>
<div class='description'>
For this exercise, follow along with the examples given below in the Python REPL. Experiment with the sample code, to ensure you understand the concepts presented.

The <strong>in</strong> operator can be used to answer the question: does a sequence of items (like a list or a string, for example) contain a given sub-sequence? It returns simply True or False (i.e. it's a Boolean operator).

Conversely, the <strong>not in</strong> operator returns True if a given sequence <em>does not contain</em> a given sub-sequence; and False otherwise.

The following examples show how this works with strings.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> 'o' in 'hello world'
True
>>> 'a' in 'hello world'
False
>>> 'world' in 'hello world'
True
>>> 'apple' not in 'hello world'
True
>>>
</pre>The following examples show how this works with lists.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'kiwi', 'orange', 'pineapple']
>>> 'kiwi' in fruit
True
>>> ['kiwi', 'orange'] in fruit
False
>>> 'pear' in fruit
False
>>> 'pear' not in fruit
True
>>>
</pre></div>
