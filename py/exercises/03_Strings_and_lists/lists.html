<h3>Working with lists</h3>
<div class='description'>
For this exercise, follow along with the examples given below in the Python REPL. Experiment with the sample code, to ensure you understand the concepts presented.

A comma-separated sequence of values enclosed in square brackets is called a <strong>list</strong>.

Here are some sample lists:
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> list_of_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> list_of_numbers
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>>
>>> list_of_strings = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
>>> list_of_strings
['red', 'green', 'blue']
>>>
>>> list_of_different_types = [3, 'red', True, 6.8]
>>> list_of_different_types
[3, 'red', True, 6.8]
>>>
</pre>A list is an example of a <em>data structure</em>. Data structures allow us to store and process potentially large amounts of data, all referenced via a single program variable.

The len() function returns the number of items in a list i.e. its length:
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> len(list_of_strings)
3
>>>
</pre>A list with no items in it is called the <em>empty</em> list.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> empty_list = []
>>> empty_list
[]
>>> len(empty_list)
0
>>>
</pre>A for-loop can be used to iterate over the items in a list.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> for item in list_of_strings:
...     print(item)
... 
red
green
blue
>>>
</pre>Each individual item in the list can be referenced using the index operator, which in its simplest form consists of the position of the item in the list (the item's <em>index</em>) enclosed in square brackets.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> list_of_strings[0]
'red'
>>> list_of_strings[1]
'green'
>>> list_of_strings[2]
'blue'
>>> list_of_strings[3]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
>>>
</pre>Notice that attempting to reference an item that does not exist generates an error.

The index operator provides us with another way that we can iterate over the items in a list.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> for i in range(len(list_of_strings)):
...     print("Item", i, "is", list_of_strings[i])
... 
Item 0 is red
Item 1 is green
Item 2 is blue
>>>
</pre>A minus sign can be used with the index operator to reference items in the list starting from the back.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> list_of_strings[-1]
'blue'
>>> list_of_strings[-2]
'green'
>>>
</pre>A colon can be used with the index operator to specify a range of values (aka a <em>slice</em>).
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> list_of_numbers[1:3]
[2, 3]
>>> list_of_strings[1:]
['green', 'blue']
>>> list_of_strings[:2] 
['red', 'green']
>>>
</pre>Items in a list can be overwritten:
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> list_of_strings[2] = 'purple'
>>> list_of_strings
['red', 'green', 'purple']
>>>
</pre>We say that lists are <em>mutable</em>, because their content can be changed.

The .insert() method can be used to insert new values into a list before a given index; and the .append() method can be used to add new items to the end of a list.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> list_of_strings.insert(0, 'pink')
>>> list_of_strings
['pink', 'red', 'green', 'purple']
>>> list_of_strings.insert(2, 'brown')
>>> list_of_strings
['pink', 'red', 'brown', 'green', 'purple']
>>>
>>> list_of_strings.append('black')
>>> list_of_strings
['pink', 'red', 'brown', 'green', 'purple', 'black']
>>>
</pre>Items can be removed from a list by value using the .remove() method; or by index using the .pop() method.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> list_of_strings.remove('brown')
>>> list_of_strings
['pink', 'red', 'green', 'purple', 'black']
>>>
>>> list_of_strings.pop(2)
'green'
>>> list_of_strings
['pink', 'red', 'purple', 'black']
>>>
</pre>Lists can be joined together using the plus operator. This is called <em>concatenation</em>.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> list_of_strings + list_of_numbers
['pink', 'red', 'purple', 'black', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>>
</pre>There really is a lot to know about lists! However, it's impossible to be a competent software developer without a good working knowledge of them.

Knowledge of the concepts presented above is key to being able to tackle many of the remaining exercises on this site, so keep referring back to this page for inspiration.

Finally, this page presented a brief summary of many of the core concepts. There's more to know. Review the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp">section on lists</a> in the Python Tutorial Site to grow your knowledge.
