<h3>Performing calculations on a list</h3>
<div class='description'>
Start a new program with the following line:
<pre class='sample-code'>
nums = [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10]
</pre>nums is a sorted list of random numbers, with values generated in the range 1 to 10.

Write additional code to calculate the following:
<ul><li>Maximum value. Use the max() function.</li>
<li>Minimum value. Use the min() function.</li>
<li>Sum. Use the sum() function.</li>
<li>Mean: divide sum by length. Use the len() function.</li>
<li>Median: the value that exists in the middle of the sorted list. Use integer division (//) to find the index of the middle of the list.</li>
<li>Mode: the most frequently occuring values. This is the most tricky thing to figure out. Return to this task later, after attempting more exercises, if it's unclear how to do it now.</li></ul></div>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>
Numbers: [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10]

Max: 10

Min: 2

Sum: 102

Mean: 5.1

Median: 5

Modes: [2, 3]</pre>
