<h3>File system browser</h3>
<div class='description'>
Write a program that allows the user to interactively navigate and inspect the file system.

The program should provide a prompt for the user that shows the current working directory.

The user should then be able to type in a command. The following commands should be supported:
<pre class='sample-code'>
cd &ltpath&gt - change directory
? or help - print help
dir - list contents of current directory
quit - quit the program
type &ltfile&gt - type the contents of a file
</pre>After executing the command entered by the user, the program should re-issue the prompt to recieve the next command. This process should continue until the user enters the quit command to terminate the program.

Tips:

Listing a directory and typing a file were implemented in previous exercises. Put the code for these operations into functions to make them easy to reuse.

Use os.path.abspath('.') to get the current working directory, to make the prompt.

Use os.chdir(path) to change directory.

The following code can be used as the foundation of a program that implements an interactive REPL:
<pre class='sample-code'>
def get_command():
    instruction = input(get_prompt())

    tokens = instruction.split()

    command = tokens[0].lower() if len(tokens) > 0 else ""

    argument = tokens[1] if len(tokens) > 1 else ""

    return (command, argument)

# Interactive command loop...
(command, argument) = get_command()

while command != "quit":
    # Process command...

    # Once command has been processed, get the next command...
    (command, argument) = get_command()    
</pre></div>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>
...\source\repos\py\py-exercises\06_Files_and_directories> <strong>foo</strong>

...\source\repos\py\py-exercises\06_Files_and_directories> <strong>help</strong>
cd &ltpath&gt - change directory
? or help - print help
dir - list contents of current directory
quit - quit the program
type &ltfile&gt - type the contents of a file
