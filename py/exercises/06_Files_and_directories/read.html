<h3>Type the contents of a file</h3>
<div class='description'>
Prompt the user for the name of a file. Read and print the contents of the file.

Tips:

Use the with-statement in conjunction with the open(path, 'r') method to open a file for reading.

For example, the following line opens the file, specified by the variable path, for reading:
<pre class='sample-code'>
with open(path, 'r') as myfile:
</pre>Inside the with-block, the variable myfile can be used to perform operations on the file.

For example, the .read() method reads the contents of a file:
<pre class='sample-code'>
with open(path, 'r') as myfile:
    contents = myfile.read()
</pre></div>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>
Enter the name of a file: text.txt

File not found:  text.txt


Enter the name of a file: test.txt

----- Contents of file: test.txt -----
This is a simple text file that contains some text.

Have a nice day.

The End.
