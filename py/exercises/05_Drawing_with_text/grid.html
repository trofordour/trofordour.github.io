<h3>Representing a two dimensional grid using a list of lists</h3>
<div class='description'>
The previous exercise introduced nested lists and hopefully it is obvious that all the examples given were also representations of two dimensional grids, where the top-left element had coordinates (0, 0) and the bottom-right element had coordinates (n, m) where n is the number of elements in each list, and m is the number of lists.

To help make this more clear, here is another example where the elements contained in the lists are strings, where each string specifies the coordinates of its position in the grid.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> grid = [["(0,0)","(0,1)","(0,2)"], ["(1,0)","(1,1)","(1,2)"],["(2,0)","(2,1)","(2,2)"]]
>>> grid[0]
['(0,0)', '(0,1)', '(0,2)']
>>> grid[1]
['(1,0)', '(1,1)', '(1,2)']
>>> grid[2]
['(2,0)', '(2,1)', '(2,2)']
>>></pre>The first number in each string can be interpreted as the x-coordinate and the second number as the y-coordinate.

With a coordinate system established, it is possible to start drawing graphs, and simple pictures, using single characters to "colour" the screen.

Here's an example of representation of an X-style cross, using asterisk characters to draw the lines, and spaces to represent blank space.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> x = [["*", " ", "*"], [" ", "*", " "], ["*", " ", "*"]]
>>></pre>Here's a program to draw the cross.
<pre class='sample-code'>
def display_canvas(canvas):
    for row in canvas:
        print("".join(row))

x = [["*", " ", "*"], [" ", "*", " "], ["*", " ", "*"]]

display_canvas(x)
</pre>Here's the output of the above program.
<pre class='sample-code'>

</pre>As an exercise, construct your own simple picture using a two dimensional list of lists, and then use the display_canvas function shown above to display it.</div>
