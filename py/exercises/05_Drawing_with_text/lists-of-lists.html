<h3>Nested lists</h3>
<div class='description'>
By now you are familar with lists that contain simple types like numbers or strings, but what about a list that contains other lists? Here's an example:
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> items = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
>>> items
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
>>> items[0]
[1, 2, 3]
>>> items[1]
[4, 5, 6]
>>> items[2]
[7, 8, 9]
>>></pre>In the example above, each element in the list called <em>items</em> is another list. We refer to the inner lists as <em>sub-lists</em> or <em>nested-lists</em>.

We can index the individual elements in each sub-list by introducing a second instance of the indexing operator.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> items[0][0]
1
>>></pre>In the example above, the first use of [0] means <em>get the first list</em>. The second use of [0] means <em>get the first element of the list obtained from the first use of [0]</em>.

In this fashion, all the elements of the original list can be referenced.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> items[0][1]
2
>>> items[0][2]
3
>>> items[1][0]
4
>>> items[1][1]
5
>>> items[1][2]
6
>>> items[2][0]
7
>>> items[2][1]
8
>>> items[2][2]
9
>>></pre>It is usually impractical to deal with the elements of a large data structure like this each individual element at a time, so iteration is often used in conjunction with nested lists.
<pre class='sample-code'>
>>> for x in range(3): 
...     for y in range(3): 
...             print(f"items[{x}][{y}] has value {items[x][y]}")     
...
items[0][0] has value 1
items[0][1] has value 2
items[0][2] has value 3
items[1][0] has value 4
items[1][1] has value 5
items[1][2] has value 6
items[2][0] has value 7
items[2][1] has value 8
items[2][2] has value 9
>>></pre>Below is a program that generates a list of lists to represent times tables from 1 to 12.
<pre class='sample-code'>
times_tables = []

for i in range(1, 13):
    one_table = [i * j for j in range(1, 13)]

    times_tables.append(one_table)

print(times_tables)
</pre>Below is the output it produces.
<pre class='sample-code'>
[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24], [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36], [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48], [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60], [6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72], [7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84], [8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96], [9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, 108], [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120], [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 110, 121, 132], [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144]]
</pre>As an exercise, complete the above program by printing the above list-of-lists in a nicely formatted, two dimensional table.
