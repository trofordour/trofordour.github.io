<h3>Heads or tails?</h3>
<div class='description'>
Implement a simple game that prompts the user to guess what the result of the next coin toss will be - heads or tails?

Keep prompting until the user decides to quit.

In each round, use a method from the random module to decide the result of tossing a coin.

When the user quits, print the final score.</div>
