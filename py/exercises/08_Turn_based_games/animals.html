<h3>Animal guessing game</h3>
<div class='description'>
Write a program to play the animal guessing game.

In the animal guessing game the human thinks of an animal and the program tries to guess what it is.

See the sample below to see how this works.

Tips:

The program starts knowing two animals.

animals = ["cat", "dog"]

It knows one "unique" thing about each animal.

questions = ["have whiskers", "bark"]

In each round, the program runs through the list of things it knows, turning each thing into a question.

If the program runs out of things it knows, it asks for the answer so it can append it to the list of things it knows.
