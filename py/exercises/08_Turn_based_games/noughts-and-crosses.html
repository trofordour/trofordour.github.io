<h3>Noughts and crosses</h3>
<div class='description'>
Implement noughts and crosses (also known as tic-tac-toe), where a human can play against your program.

In your initial version, your program should choose a random free tile during its turn, to keep things simple.

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">wikipedia</a> page for tic-tac-toe presents an in-depth analysis of the game, with the logic that a computer would need to implement to play optimally, but implementing this is beyond the scope of these simple exercises.
